Core Editing Functions (Person 2)

Task:
1. Implement basic editing functions:
   - `resize_image(image, width, height)` to resize the image to given dimensions.
   - `crop_image(image, box)` to crop the image based on a bounding box.
   
2. Ensure proper error handling for invalid input dimensions or paths.

3. Test each function using sample images and write standalone test scripts.

Steps:
- Use Pillow for resizing, cropping, and saving images.
- Ensure that exported images retain quality and format.
- Provide clear function signatures for integration into the GUI.
