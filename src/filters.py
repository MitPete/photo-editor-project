Filters and Effects (Person 3)

Task:
1. Develop filters and effects for the photo editor:
   - Implement grayscale, sepia, blur, brightness adjustment, and other filters.
2. Write reusable functions for each filter:
   - Example: `apply_grayscale(image)` or `apply_sepia(image)`.
3. Test each filter independently with sample images to ensure proper functionality.

Steps:
- Use Pillow and NumPy for advanced image transformations.
- Provide clear function signatures for integration into the GUI.
- Ensure filters work without degrading image quality.
