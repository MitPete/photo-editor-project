Drawing and Text Tools (Person 4)

Task:
1. Add interactive tools for drawing and text overlays:
   - Implement a drawing tool using Pillow's `ImageDraw` module.
   - Create a text tool to add captions or annotations to images, with options for font, size, and color.
2. Implement an undo/redo system:
   - Maintain a stack of image states to allow users to revert or redo actions.
3. Test these tools independently to ensure accuracy and usability.

Steps:
- Use Pillowâ€™s `ImageDraw` to draw shapes and add text.
- Create a simple history mechanism for undo/redo functionality.
- Ensure the tools integrate seamlessly with the GUI.
